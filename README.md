# Foxwyn's Neocities Site
This repo contains the source code for my personal Neocities website, which can be [visited here](https://foxwyn.neocities.org).

The contents of the website are contained within the `site` directory. A git hook has been configured to auto-deploy the site when running `git push`.

This can also be done manually by running the following command from the top-level project directory:

```console
neocities push site
```

The documentation for the CLI and this process can be [found here](https://neocities.org/cli) on the official Neocities site.
