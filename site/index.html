      <p>I am Foxwyn! I am brand-new to Neocities, and my HTML/CSS knowledge is kinda dusty these days. I've seen so many cute projects on here, I was inspired to give it a go myself. I can't promise it'll come anywhere near close to the quality and creativity of other sites, but, I hope I'm able to make something that expresses me.</p>
      <p>Until the site is more fleshed-out, here are a few things I enjoy: cats, coffee, computers, cutesty things, pastel colors, colorful-things in general, meowing, possums.</p>
